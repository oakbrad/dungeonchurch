While concentrating on this spell, you can use an action to trace your hand over any non-magical text or imagery on a surface within range. You imprint the text or imagery onto parchment you provide, choosing how to resize or crop it. This spell copies a single page with each action, and cannot copy sections larger than 9X12 inches at a time. When copying a spell book, you can do so using the same method as you would replace a spell book, except the time and gp requirements are both halved."

In the villages on the edges of humanity's reach, rumors and superstitions percolate about strange children born with unexplainable talents, echoes of long vanished Elven heroes.",
						"The Dwarven Kingdom has nearly finished the long Great Migration - abandoning their old cities to follow their Prophet-King across the Azure Sea and into the mountains of the west. Their new granite city of Durandar rises as a center of technological innovation, as the dwarves reject magic in favor of molding the mountain's inner fire and rivers into great power.",
						"The Dragonborn, once the conscripted foot soldiers of the Empire's army, have been instrumental in the reclaiming of the port of New Galmaarden into a democratic city with free elections in the east. Others seek out a simpler life among the Tribeborn in the vast wilderness - away from the wars & schemes of humanity.",
						"Between the two new cities lies the older human stronghold, Striborg, at a crucial trade point on the peninsula. With it's well funded naval control of the strait and ambitious aristocratic ruling class, the city’s influence extends far beyond it’s walls as the hoofsteps of the Iron Riders echo down the newly safe roads throughout the land.",
						"Beneath this veneer of progress & opportunity, the old threats still lurk, plotting for their moment to reemerge and propel the endless cycle of fate & magic forward again."

Monsters gather beneath the waves & drowned sailors stir to unnatural life, animated by dark magic. The cult of a dead god silently grows it's reach. The nearby woods house mind-bending horrors. Mercenary groups seek abandoned treasures in the old dwarven mine.",
